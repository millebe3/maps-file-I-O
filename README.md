# maps-file-I-O
C++ exercise in using maps, file input and output.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
// Title: main.cpp
// Author: Ben Miller
// Date: 6/14/2023
// Purpose: Program that reads in text items (single word on a line) from a file and 
// counts how many times each item is listed in the file.  Each item and its numerical 
// occurance is output to the user and written to another file.  User is presented with 
// choices for output.

What did you do particularly well?
// good use of maps 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
// Project needs better exception handling, better use of a class.  Needs a better open archetecture structure.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
// The challenging part for me was implementing the Mapquest class.  The project didn't seem to have much use for a new class, and 
// rather seemed to benefit most from creating different methods.  

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
// nice use of input file and output file, and also maps.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
// The program is somewhat maintainable- changing file names, for instance, by using a variable to store the file name.
// The menu displayed to the user is contained in a single function.  
// The program is very readable, utilizing space in the program, function headers, aligned comments.  
// The program is somewhat adaptable- only a few messages to the user and variable names would need to be changed to adapt the  
// program for a different type of item.  The menu and file input / output functionality is generic.
